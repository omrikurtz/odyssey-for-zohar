### Part 1: The Homeric Question & The Theme of Xenia

**The Authorship Debate (The Homeric Question)**

* The "Homeric Question" debates the historicity of Homer, his origins, and whether he composed both the *Iliad* and the *Odyssey* .


* Ancient "separatists" (the *Horizontes* from the 2nd century BC) argued that the *Odyssey* was the work of a different, later poet .


* However, the prevalent ancient view and a common modern convention is that both epics are the product of a single unparalleled poetic genius. Modern translators like Richmond Lattimore and Robert Fagles attribute the *Odyssey* to Homer .



**Shared Traditions: The Iliad vs. The Odyssey**

* 
**Similarities:** Both are products of an oral tradition, using recurring epithets, formulaic phrases, and the same Homeric dialect . Both are set in the Heroic Age, featuring extraordinary men, beautiful women, and gods walking among mortals .


* 
**Continuity:** The *Odyssey* assumes knowledge of the *Iliad*. Heroes like Menelaus, Nestor, Helen, and Agamemnon reappear . Achilles appears as a ghost in the Underworld (Hades), famously stating he would rather be a slave among the living than a king among the dead .


* 
**Thematic Shift:** While the *Iliad* is a poem of war, sorrow, and the heroic code , the *Odyssey* takes place in a time of troubled peace .



**The Core Principle: Xenia**

* 
**Definition:** *Xenia* is the sacred, religiously mandated relationship between host and guest in the archaic Greek world, serving as a substitute for international law in a time of rampant piracy .


* 
**Rules of Xenia:** Hosts must provide food, drink, and shelter to wandering strangers/suppliants, and guests are given a "guest gift" upon parting to ensure future reciprocal safety . Guests must also show moderation ("nothing in excess") .


* 
**Divine Patron:** Zeus oversees this custom and is titled *Zeus Xenios* (Zeus of the strangers/suppliants) . Violators are severely punished.


* **Key Examples in the Epic:**
* 
*The Good:* The Phaeacians offer exemplary hospitality to Odysseus . Telemachus cordially hosts a disguised Athena .


* 
*The Bad:* The 108 suitors abuse the custom, exceeding moderation by consuming Odysseus's livelihood daily . Polyphemus the Cyclops violates it entirely by eating his guests .





#### Part 1: Verify-Knowledge Questions

1. Who were the *Horizontes* and what did they believe regarding Homer's epics?
2. How does Achilles's perspective on life and glory change between the *Iliad* and his appearance in the *Odyssey*?
3. What is *Xenia*, who is its divine patron, and why was it practically necessary in the archaic Greek world?
4. How do the suitors of Penelope violate the Greek concept of moderation within the context of *Xenia*?

### Part 2: Structure, Timeline, and Plot Overview

**Timeline and Technical Composition**

* According to Aristotle's *Poetics*, the physical action of the *Odyssey* unfolds over roughly six weeks .


* The narrative begins 20 years after the start of the Trojan War (10 years after its conclusion).


* Homer's technical genius lies in telling the bulk of Odysseus's famous adventures in retrospect .



**The 24 Books of the Odyssey**

* 
**Books 1-4 (Telemachus's Journey):** Focuses on Odysseus's son, Telemachus, coming of age . Frustrated by the haughty suitors, he sails to Pylos (to see Nestor) and Sparta (to see Menelaus) to inquire about his father . Telemachus has grown his first beard, signaling the time Penelope was instructed to remarry if Odysseus had not returned . Odysseus does not actively appear here.


* 
**Books 5-8 (Release and Phaeacia):** Odysseus has spent 7 years as an unwilling (or willing) prisoner of the nymph Calypso on the island of Ogygia . Forced by the gods, she releases him . Shipwrecked by Poseidon, he lands in Scheria, where Princess Nausicaa and King Alcinous of the Phaeacians take him in . Geography here is impossible to trace accurately, dubbed "fairyland" .


* 
**Books 9-12 (The Great Flashback):** Odysseus tells the Phaeacians of his 3 years of wandering . Key adventures include:


* The Lotus Eaters (makes men forgetful).


* Polyphemus the Cyclops .


* Aeolus (King of winds, gives a bag of winds the crew foolishly opens) .


* Circe (turns men to swine, entertains Odysseus for a year) .


* The *Nekuia* (journey to the Underworld in Book 11) .


* Thrinacia (crew eats Helios's cattle and are destroyed; Odysseus alone survives) .




* 
**Books 13-24 (Return and Revenge):** The Phaeacians sail him to Ithaca loaded with treasure . Athena disguises him as an old beggar so the 108 suitors don't instantly kill him .


* 
*Recognitions:* He reveals himself by degrees to his son Telemachus and loyal swineherd Eumaeus. He is recognized by his dying 20-year-old dog, Argos , and his old nurse Eurycleia (by a distinctive leg scar) .


* 
*The Contest & Slaughter:* Penelope decrees she will marry the man who strings Odysseus's bow and shoots through 12 axe rings . The beggar (Odysseus) succeeds, and with Telemachus, slaughters the suitors .


* 
*Reunion:* Penelope tests him with their immovable bed (built around an olive tree stump) to confirm his identity . Athena finally pacifies the angry families of the dead suitors .





**Translation Note**

* Robert Fagles' translation is highly acclaimed for its eloquence . Unlike Lattimore's line-for-line translation, Fagles utilizes a custom meter that expands the line count without adding extra information .



#### Part 2: Verify-Knowledge Questions

1. Why does Telemachus's growing of his first beard create an urgent timeline for Penelope?
2. Describe the narrative framing of Odysseus's most famous adventures (Books 9-12). How are they presented to the reader?
3. Why does Athena disguise Odysseus as a beggar when he finally reaches Ithaca in Book 13?
4. How does Penelope ultimately test Odysseus to prove he is truly her husband?

### Part 3: Textual Analysis of Book 1 & Book 9

**Book 1: The Proem and The Divine Council**

* 
**The Proem (Invocation):** "Sing to me of the man, Muse...". Unlike Achilles, driven by rage and impetuosity, Odysseus is the man of "twists and turns"—defined by his intellect, subtlety, and ingenuity . The proem spoils the end: Odysseus fails to save his comrades because they recklessly ate the cattle of the Sun God .


* 
**The Divine Council:** While Poseidon is away feasting with the Ethiopians , the gods gather. Zeus complains that humans always blame the gods for miseries caused by their own reckless actions . He uses Aegisthus as an example—Hermes warned him not to kill Agamemnon or court his wife, but he did it anyway and paid the price .


* 
**Athena's Plea:** Athena points out that Odysseus is God-fearing and deserves to go home . Zeus agrees, blaming Odysseus's delay entirely on Poseidon's rage over the blinding of his son, the Cyclops Polyphemus .



**Book 9: The Cyclops Episode**

* 
**The Setup:** Accompanied by 12 ships, Odysseus gives into his "irresistible curiosity" to explore a nearby island to see if the inhabitants are savage or God-fearing . He brings an irresistible, miraculous wine given by Maron, priest of Apollo .


* 
**The Trap:** Odysseus has a premonition of a lawless giant . His crew wants to steal cheese and flee, but Odysseus refuses, demanding *Xenia* (guest gifts) . Polyphemus the Cyclops returns, trapping them inside by moving a massive boulder over the cave entrance .


* 
**The Confrontation:** Odysseus invokes *Zeus Xenios* and asks for hospitality . Polyphemus mocks the gods, committing hubris, and claims the Cyclopes are stronger than Zeus . He then brutally devours two of Odysseus's men .


* **The Twist/Ingenuity:** Odysseus contemplates stabbing the Cyclops in the liver but stops himself. His intellect ("twists and turns") saves him: if he kills the giant, they will all die trapped in the cave because they cannot move the boulder . A different scheme is required (to be detailed in the next lecture) .



#### Part 3: Verify-Knowledge Questions

1. How does the invocation of the *Odyssey* contrast Odysseus's primary traits with those of Achilles?
2. What specific example does Zeus use to prove that mortals cause their own misery through recklessness?
3. What critical mistake does Odysseus make out of his desire for *Xenia* when first entering the Cyclops's cave?
4. Why doesn't Odysseus simply kill Polyphemus the first night while the giant sleeps?

### Final Review: Mixed Questions

1. Compare and contrast how *Xenia* is demonstrated in the households of Alcinous (Phaeacians), Polyphemus (Cyclops), and Odysseus (Suitors).
2. What is the significance of the formulaic phrase "When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone..." in understanding the compositional history of the text?
3. How does the overarching theme of the *Odyssey* reflect a transition from the world of the *Iliad*?
4. Explain how the narrative of the *Odyssey* manipulates time, given that it spans 20 years of history but only 6 weeks of real-time action.
