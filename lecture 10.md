## Part 1: Virgil's Aeneid – The Tragic End of Dido

### The Setup and The "Marriage"

* Aeneas and his fleet were involuntarily swept to Carthage in North Africa due to a storm roused by Juno.


* Juno aimed to unite the Carthaginians and the Trojans, though mythologically this encounter sowed the seeds for future enmity between the two peoples.


* Venus arranged for her son Cupid to strike Dido with an accursed love for Aeneas, which ultimately drove her mad and led to her suicide.


* During a hunt, Juno created a storm that forced Aeneas and Dido into a cave alone, where they had sexual intercourse.


* Dido viewed this cave encounter as a lawful marriage, as she had previously sworn an oath of chastity to her murdered first husband, Sychaeus.



### The Departure and The Curse

* Aeneas was ordered by Jupiter to leave Carthage and set sail to found a new race.


* Aeneas told Dido that the choice was not his and that he would have preferred to remain at Troy, not Carthage.


* Mercury appeared to Aeneas in a dream, warning him to sail immediately before the Carthaginians could attack.


* Upon seeing the Trojans sail away, Dido cursed Aeneas, prophesying the rise of an unknown avenger from her bones (foreshadowing Hannibal). * Dido's curse declared eternal warfare between the shores, waves, and arms of the Carthaginians and the descendants of the Trojans.



### Dido's Suicide

* Dido deceived her loyal sister, Anna, into building a pyre under the guise of performing a purifying ceremony to rid her of her burning passion for Aeneas.


* Dido climbed the pyre and unsheathed a Trojan sword, a gift left by Aeneas.


* Before dying, she reflected on her accomplishments—establishing a bright city and avenging her husband against her hostile brother, Pygmalion.


* She wished for Aeneas to see the flames of her pyre from the sea as an omen of death.


* Anna was stricken with grief and anger that Dido did not take her to Hades with her.


* Juno took pity on Dido and sent the rainbow goddess Iris to cut a lock of Dido's hair, releasing her soul from her body.


* From his ship, Aeneas saw the flames of the pyre and felt a deep foreboding, knowing what a crazed woman and unrequited love could cause.

2. What historical figure and conflict are foreshadowed by Dido's dying curse?
3. How did Dido trick her sister Anna into building the funeral pyre?
4. What role did the goddess Iris play in Dido's final moments?

## Part 2: Apollonius Rhodius & The Argonautica Background

### The Author and The Hellenistic World

* Apollonius Rhodius lived in the 3rd century BC in Alexandria, Egypt, which was the greatest cultural center of the known world at the time. * He served as the chief librarian at the great library of Alexandria, which collected all ancient science and knowledge.


* According to anecdote, a poor initial reception of his poem in Alexandria led him to flee in shame to Rhodes, where he reworked it, gained acclaim, and earned the name "Apollonius of Rhodes".


* He was immensely erudite and wrote foundation poems tracing the origins of cities, as well as literary treatises on Homer.



### Homeric Influences vs. Hellenistic Innovations

| Feature | Influence / Comparison |
| --- | --- |
| **Language** | Wrote in the Homeric epic dialect (dactylic hexameter), which was an entirely artificial and unspoken language by the 3rd century BC.

 |
| **Literary Devices** | Used catalogs of heroes (mimicking the Iliad's catalog of ships), extended similes to heighten tension, and *ekphrasis* (poetical descriptions of art, like Jason's embroidered cloak).

 |
| **Repetition** | Unlike Homer's oral poetry, Apollonius's written epic lacks the systematic, methodical repetition of lines and paragraphs.

 |
| **Scope** | Reflected Hellenistic interests with deep explorations of geography, anthropology, and foreign customs, influenced by Alexander the Great's expansions.

### An Initiation Myth

* The *Argonautica* is classified as an "initiation myth" because its protagonists begin as youths rather than fully-fledged heroes.


* Unlike Achilles, who is fully formed at the start of the Iliad, Jason begins the epic young, hesitant, and lacking exemplary leadership skills.


* Through his trials, Jason matures into an experienced and authoritative leader.


* Medea enters the plot as an innocent 16-year-old sorceress and transforms into a tragic hero capable of betraying her father and instigating her brother's murder.



### Part 2: Verify Your Knowledge

1. Why is the author referred to as Apollonius "of Rhodes" if he was from Alexandria?
2. What is an *ekphrasis* and how did Apollonius use it?
3. Name two distinct ways Apollonius's epic differed stylistically from Homer's epics.
4. Why is the *Argonautica* considered an "initiation myth" regarding the character of Jason?

## Part 3: The Argonautica – Plot & Textual Analysis

### Epic Structure and Proem

* The *Argonautica* is divided into four long books, consisting of 5,885 hexameter lines, which is shorter than Homer's works.


* Books one and two cover the departure from Greece and the voyage to the Caucasus, while books three and four cover the love story of Medea, gaining the fleece, and returning home.


* The proem (introduction) invokes Apollo as the initiator of the song, and later invokes the Muses.


* Apollonius states he will not retell the building of the Argo, as other singers have done it; instead, he focuses on the catalog of heroes and their voyage.



### The Mission and The Golden Fleece

* King Pelias usurped the throne of Iolcus from Jason's father and received a prophecy that a "one-sandaled man" would cause his death. * When Jason arrived wearing one sandal, Pelias sent him on a suicidal mission to fetch the Golden Fleece.


* The Argonauts included the flower of Grecian heroism, such as Orpheus, Peleus (Achilles' father), and Heracles.


* They sailed the tight-thwarted ship Argo through the Bosphorus Straits, passing the dangerous "crashing rocks".



### The Fall of Medea

* Book Three opens with a new invocation to Erato, the muse of love elegy, to explain how love secured the fleece.


* King Aeetes of Colchis refused to hand over the fleece, which was guarded by an ever-wakeful serpent.


* Goddesses Hera and Athena asked Aphrodite to send Eros (Cupid) to make Aeetes's daughter, Medea, fall madly in love with Jason.


* Eros arrived unseen, compared to a stinging gadfly, and shot an unhandselled arrow into Medea's heart, rendering her speechless.


* Apollonius heightens the intensity of Medea's sudden passion using an extended simile: he compares her love to a poor spinning woman kindling a massive fire from a smoldering brand in the dark.


* Love is described not as beautiful, but as "the destroyer".


* The physical effect of love flushes Medea's cheeks and drains them of color, a description that heavily influenced Virgil's later portrayal of Dido.



### Part 3: Verify Your Knowledge

1. What was the prophecy that King Pelias feared, and how did Jason fulfill it upon his arrival?
2. Which specific Muse does Apollonius invoke at the start of Book Three, and why?
3. Describe the extended simile used to illustrate Medea falling in love.
4. How does Medea's physical reaction to being struck by Eros's arrow parallel Dido's behavior in the *Aeneid*?

## Mixed Review Questions

1. Both Dido and Medea are struck by a god of love to assist a hero. Compare the circumstances and the gods involved in both epics.
2. In what ways did Apollonius Rhodius's background in Alexandria shape the themes (like geography and anthropology) in the *Argonautica*?
3. Trace the "initiation myth" concept through Jason's journey. How does his starting point differ from Aeneas's starting point as an established Trojan leader?
4. How do extended similes function during moments of high tension in epic poetry? Provide examples from both the *Aeneid* (or Homeric influence) and the *Argonautica*.
5. Virgil was heavily influenced by Apollonius. Identify the exact physical description shared by both Medea (when infected by love) and Dido (before her suicide).
