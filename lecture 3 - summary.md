I know studying for a literature exam can feel like an odyssey in itself! It is a lot of dense material to parse, but I have organized the entirety of your lecture transcript into a comprehensive, easily digestible study guide. I have also included review questions throughout to help you test your retention.

Here is your study guide covering Homer's *Odyssey* and Ovid's *Heroides*.

## Part 1: The Odyssey (Book 9) – The Cave of Polyphemus

### Xenia and the Transgression of Polyphemus

* The sacred principle of *Xenia*—the obligation to provide hospitality to guests and suppliants—is a central theme of the epic.


* Zeus Xenios is the specific aspect of Zeus that protects guests and suppliants.


* Polyphemus commits a great transgression against this custom, operating out of extreme *Hubris* (overweening pride).


* He defiantly claims that Cyclopes are far better and stronger than the gods, including Zeus.


* Instead of following the civilized custom (*Themis*) of offering guest gifts, Polyphemus claims it is entirely up to his own urge whether he spares Odysseus and his men.


* He brutally snatches two of Odysseus's companions and devours them like a mountain lion.



### The Triumph of Reason Over Instinct

* A defining characteristic of Odysseus is his ability to exercise reason before yielding to instinctive impulses.


* This stands in stark contrast to Achilles from the *Iliad*, who is known for being impulsive and impetuous.


* Odysseus's initial instinct is to stab the sleeping Cyclops in the liver, but a fresh thought holds him back.


* He realizes that if he kills the Cyclops, he and his men will be permanently trapped, as they cannot move the massive stone slab blocking the cave's entrance.



### The Trap and The Blinding

* To prepare his weapon, Odysseus chops a length from Polyphemus's olive club, shaves it to a point, chars it in the fire, and hides it beneath the wet dung on the cave floor.


* He casts lots to select four men to help him, making a team of five.


* Odysseus outwits the Cyclops by offering him a marvelously strong wine given to him by Maron.


* Polyphemus enjoys the wine so much he compares it to nectar and ambrosia flowing from heaven.


* Odysseus calls Polyphemus a "barbarian," which in ancient Greece meant a non-Greek who lacked culture, refinement, and the proper treatment of guests.


* Employing his famous cunning, Odysseus tells Polyphemus his name is *Outis*, meaning "Nobody" or "No man".


* In return for the wine, Polyphemus offers a cynical and cruel guest gift: he promises to eat "Nobody" last.


* Once the Cyclops is drunkenly vomiting human flesh and wine in his sleep, Odysseus and his men heat the olive stake and bore it into his eye.


* Homer uses a vivid simile to describe this blinding: it is compared to the hissing sound of a blacksmith plunging a glowing axe into an ice-cold bath to temper the iron.



### The Escape and The Curse

* The blinding leads to a brilliant double entendre: when the other Cyclopes come to check on the screaming Polyphemus, he yells, "nobody is killing me now by fraud and not by force".


* The other Cyclopes take this literally, assuming no one is hurting him and that his madness must be a plague sent by Zeus.


* They advise him to pray to his father, Lord Poseidon.


* To escape the cave, Odysseus binds sheep together in triplets, hiding a man under the belly of the middle sheep, while he hides under the greatest ram.


* Once safely on his ship, Odysseus makes a massive error by taunting Polyphemus and revealing his true identity: Odysseus, Raider of cities, Laertes' son, who makes his home in Ithaca.


* This triggers Polyphemus's memory of an old prophecy warning that an Odysseus would blind him, though the Cyclops had expected a giant warrior, not a "dwarf".


* Polyphemus prays to Poseidon, asking that Odysseus never reaches home.


* The curse specifies that if Odysseus is fated to return, he must come late, as a broken man, having lost all shipmates, aboard a stranger's ship, and finding a world of pain at home.


* The entire curse ultimately comes to pass, concluding with 108 haughty suitors consuming his wealth back in Ithaca.



### Verify-Knowledge Questions: Part 1

1. What is the Greek term for the sacred obligation of hospitality, and which god protects it?
2. How does Odysseus's reaction to the Cyclops contrast with Achilles' typical behavior?
3. What does the name *Outis* mean, and how does it secure Odysseus's escape from the other Cyclopes?
4. Detail the specific conditions of Polyphemus's curse against Odysseus.

## Part 2: Ovid’s Heroides – Penelope’s Epistle

### Background and Genre Shift

* Ovid was a learned Roman poet born in 43 BC during the golden age of Latin poetry, writing roughly 700 years after Homer.


* The *Heroides* is a collection of 21 epistles.


* Epistles 1 to 15 are written by mythological heroines to their absent lovers, except for the 15th, which is written by the historical poetess Sappho.


* Epistles 16 to 21 are double epistles, featuring a hero's letter and his beloved's response.


* Ovid transforms the narrative from a heroic epic into love elegy, a genre that is shorter, more personal, and driven by strong emotions.


* While heroic poetry uses the hexameter meter, love elegy is written in elegiac couplets.


* An elegiac couplet consists of one line of hexameter followed by one line of pentameter.



### Ovid's Penelope vs. Homer's Penelope

* Homer’s Penelope is relatively passive and tame; she is the exemplar of loyalty who accepts the gods' decrees and finds no fault with Odysseus's conduct.


* Ovid’s Penelope is much more proactive, angry, fearful, and anxious.


* She complains about the tedious prospect of endless nights and days working like a widow at her loom.


* Ovid's Penelope actively blames Odysseus for being tardy and accuses him of loitering in a foreign place.


* She expresses fear that he has become fickle or that he describes her to others as simpleminded and only fit for keeping his house.



### Irony, Emotion, and Manipulation

* The dramatic irony of the epistle is that Penelope is likely writing it on the eve of the bow and axe contest, mere hours before Odysseus reveals himself.


* She gives the letter to the beggar in her house, completely unaware that the stranger is actually Odysseus in disguise.


* Her intense anxiety is likened to a line from Shakespeare's *Hamlet*: "where love is great, the littlest doubts are fears".


* She demonstrates extensive knowledge of the Trojan War, imagining hazards and fearing for Odysseus whenever she heard of Hector, or the deaths of Antilochus and Patroclus.


* She sarcastically criticizes Odysseus for his Book 10 night raid with Diomedes, accusing him of risking his life and slaughtering enemies while forgetting about her.


* Penelope uses exaggeration in her grief, claiming that fields of grain now grow peacefully on the site of Troy, even though it has only been 10 years.


* The letter contains a direct falsehood: she claims she sent word to Nestor at Pylos and the Spartans, but it was actually her son Telemachus who sailed there independently.


* Odysseus, reading the letter as the beggar, would immediately recognize this manipulation, as he had already met Telemachus and knew his son acted on his own accord.


* She lists the suitors tormenting her (Pisander, Polybus, Medon, Eurymachus, Antinous) but mistakenly refers to the beggar Irus as one of Odysseus's servants.


* She concludes by reminding him that she was a young girl when he left, and though she is now an old woman, she remains loyal.



(Note: The lecture mentions that the following week's topic will cover Hesiod's works, specifically the Theogony and Works and Days.)

### Verify-Knowledge Questions: Part 2

1. Explain the structural difference between the meter used in heroic epic versus love elegy.
2. How does Ovid's depiction of Penelope's personality and attitude toward Odysseus differ from Homer's?
3. What is the great dramatic irony surrounding the delivery of Penelope's epistle?
4. What falsehood does Penelope include in her letter regarding her efforts to find Odysseus?

## Part 3: Mixed Review Questions

1. Compare how pride (*Hubris*) functions in Book 9 of the *Odyssey* (through Polyphemus) versus how anger and irony function in Ovid's *Heroides* (through Penelope).
2. What specific event in the *Iliad* does Penelope sarcastically reference to accuse Odysseus of forgetting about her safety?
3. How do the similes and imagery Homer uses to describe the blinding of Polyphemus contrast with the hyperbolic imagery Penelope uses to describe the ruins of Troy?
4. Why is the concept of a "barbarian" crucial to understanding Odysseus's judgment of the Cyclops's behavior?
5. How does Odysseus's revelation of his true name parallel Penelope's inclusion of falsehoods in her letter? In both cases, how does information (or misinformation) shape the outcome of the characters' circumstances?
