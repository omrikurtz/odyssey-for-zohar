# Study Guide: Homer's *Iliad* (Lecture 1)

## Part 1: Background, Language, and Epic Forms

### The Homeric Question & Authorship

* The "Homeric Question" debates whether Homer was a real historical figure, whether he alone composed both the *Iliad* and the *Odyssey*, and what traditions he relied upon.


* While he might have known writing existed, it is highly probable he had no practical ability to use it to record these epics.


* The poems were composed orally and transmitted by heart by professional singers called *aoidoi* (singular: *aoidos*).


* For the ancient Greeks, Homer was unquestionably a real person; the historian Herodotus believed Homer lived about 400 years before his own time.


* Homer's work was the foundation of ancient Greek education, with schoolboys required to memorize large parts or the entirety of the epics.



### Language and Meter

* The *Iliad* is ancient Greek poetry written in verse, specifically utilizing a meter called **dactylic hexameter**.


* This meter consists of six metrical feet: the first five are dactyls (one long syllable followed by two short ones: "tum-ta-ta"), and the final foot is a spondee (two long syllables: "tum-tum").


* The *Iliad* is composed in the "Homeric dialect," an artificial dialect created by the *aoidoi* strictly for reciting hexameter epics.


* This dialect was never spoken as an everyday language anywhere in the ancient Greek world (like classical Athens' Attic dialect).


* Translators face challenges replicating the exact meter, but translations like Richmond Lattimore's (1950s) are praised for retaining the original's vigor and using archaic English words (like "helm" for helmet) to mimic the ancient, otherworldly feel the original Greeks experienced.



### Scope and Introduction (The Proemium)

* The *Iliad* consists of 24 books and 15,693 lines of hexameter.


* A continuous recitation takes about 17 hours, meaning it was likely performed in segments over multiple days.


* The ancient audience already knew the story (e.g., Hector's death), but listened for the artistic performance, the otherworldliness of the heroic age (set in the 13th century BC, featuring demigods), and the music of the poetry.


* The first seven lines form the **proemium**, which introduces the poem's central theme: **the wrath of Achilles**.


* The poem begins with an "invocation of the muse" ("Sing goddess..."), a plea for divine assistance because reciting the epic was viewed as a superhuman task.


* 
*Note:* The poet refers to the Greek forces as Achaeans, Argives, Danaans, or Hellenes, but never "Greeks".



**Verify-Knowledge Questions (Part 1):**

1. What is the precise name of the meter used in the *Iliad*, and how is it structured?
2. Why is it inaccurate to say the *Iliad* was written in the everyday language of the ancient Athenians?
3. What is a *proemium*, and what is the primary theme stated in the *Iliad*'s proemium?

## Part 2: The Wrath of Achilles (Books 1 & 9)

### The Inciting Incident

* In Book 1, a conflict erupts between Achilles and Supreme Commander Agamemnon over captured women distributed as war booty.


* Agamemnon's prize is the daughter of a priest of Apollo; when the priest begs for her return, Agamemnon shamefully banishes him.


* The priest prays to Apollo, who unleashes a devastating plague upon the Achaean camp for nine days.


* On the 10th day, Achilles calls an assembly where a priest reveals Apollo's anger is directed at Agamemnon.


* Agamemnon agrees to return the girl to save the army but demands immediate compensation, threatening to take a prize from another king—specifically targeting Achilles.



### The Dispute and The Embassy

* Achilles insults Agamemnon (calling him "wrapped in shamelessness") and threatens to take his "curved ships" back home to Phthia/Thessaly.


* Agamemnon dismisses the threat, claiming he has others to do him honor, including "Zeus of the councils".


* A devastated Achilles asks his mother, the goddess Thetis, to convince Zeus to aid the Trojans so Agamemnon will realize his disastrous mistake.


* By Book 9, the Greeks are suffering heavy losses; Agamemnon repents and sends an embassy (Odysseus, Ajax, and Phoenix) offering massive gifts to Achilles to return.


* Achilles stubbornly refuses, calling Agamemnon's worth as light as a "splinter" and stating that his own life is more valuable than all of Troy's treasures.



### Achilles's Double Fate

* Achilles reveals his mother told him he carries two destinies:
1. Stay and fight: He will die, but win everlasting glory.


2. Sail home: He will live a long life, but lose his glory.




* At this point, Achilles plans to sail home the next day.



**Verify-Knowledge Questions (Part 2):**

1. What triggers Apollo to send a plague upon the Achaean camp?
2. How does Agamemnon respond to Achilles's threat to sail home?
3. What are the two distinct fates Thetis foretells for her son, Achilles?

## Part 3: The Heroic Code and Tragedy (Books 6 & 16)

### Hector and Andromache

* Book 6 features a poignant, accidental meeting between Hector and his wife, Andromache, at the gates of Troy.


* Andromache begs Hector to stop fighting, warning that his strength will kill him and leave her a widow and their son an orphan.


* She reveals her tragic past in an epic digression: Achilles ("brilliant Achilles") slaughtered her father (Eetion) and her seven brothers. Because she has no family left, Hector is her father, mother, brother, and husband.



### The Heroic Code and Fatalism

* Hector refuses to stop fighting. He knows in his heart that Troy will fall, King Priam will die, and his people will perish.


* However, bound by the **heroic code**, he must fight bravely in the foremost ranks to avoid shame and win immortal, deathless glory (to become a song for future generations).


* A deeply emotional scene occurs with their baby, Astyanax. The baby screams, terrified by Hector's bronze and horse-hair helmet. Hector laughs, removes the helmet, tosses his son, and prays to Zeus that Astyanax will become a greater warrior than himself.


* Hector espouses fatalism: No man, brave or coward, escapes fate once it takes form. He leaves for battle, and his household begins mourning him while he is still alive, knowing he will not return.



### The Fall of Patroclus

* Achilles's stubborn refusal of Agamemnon's apology leads to his tragic downfall.


* In Book 16, Achilles's close friend Patroclus enters the battle to save the Greek fleet.


* Patroclus is killed by a combination of three foes: Apollo (who strikes his armor), a common soldier named Eus (who stabs him), and Hector (who delivers the final blow and strips his armor).


* This tragedy forces Achilles to realize he cannot sail home; he must stay to avenge his friend.



**Verify-Knowledge Questions (Part 3):**

1. Why does Hector choose to return to battle even though he knows Troy is doomed?
2. What happens when Hector tries to hold his infant son, Astyanax, and how does Hector resolve it?
3. Who are the three figures responsible for the death of Patroclus in Book 16?

## Part 4: Climax and Resolution (Books 19 - 24)

### Reconciliation and Revenge

* 
**Book 19:** Agamemnon and Achilles finally reconcile. Agamemnon claims his mind was confused by Ate, the goddess of madness/confusion, who can addle even the minds of gods like Zeus.


* 
**Book 22 (The First Peak):** Achilles returns to battle, wreaks havoc on the Trojan lines, and slays Hector with the assistance of the goddess Athena. Achilles then vengefully disrespects Hector's corpse by piercing his ankles and dragging him behind a chariot.


* 
**Book 23:** Features the funeral of Patroclus and funereal games in his honor (a section highly praised by the poet Schiller).



### The Ultimate Climax: Priam and Achilles

* 
**Book 24 (The Second Peak/Conclusion):** The gods decree that Hector's body must be returned for proper burial because he always showed them reverence.


* The gods instruct Achilles to return the body and guide old King Priam through the Greek camp in the dead of night to Achilles's hut.


* Priam unexpectedly appears and delivers a masterclass in persuasion. He asks Achilles to remember his own aging father, Peleus.


* Priam reveals he had 50 sons (19 from his wife Hecuba), but violent Ares broke the strength of most of them, leaving Hector as the sole protector.


* **The Climax:** Priam performs an unprecedented act of humility. He states he has endured what no other mortal has: stretching out his hands to kiss the hands of the man who killed his son.


* Achilles is deeply moved by this gesture and surrenders the body. The poem concludes not with the fall of Troy, but with the funeral of its greatest defender: *"And so they buried Hector, the tamer of horses"*.



**Verify-Knowledge Questions (Part 4):**

1. Who or what does Agamemnon blame for his prior foolishness during his reconciliation with Achilles?
2. Which god assists Achilles in finally slaying Hector?
3. What is the specific, unprecedented action King Priam takes to convince Achilles to return his son's body?
