## Part 1: Hesiod’s *Works and Days*

### The Story of Pandora

* 
**Etiological Myth**: The story of Pandora is an etiological myth, meaning its purpose is to explain why life is hard, full of trials, and plagued by illness.


* 
**Divine Revenge**: Life's hardships are Zeus's revenge against both Prometheus and mortal humans.


* 
**Prometheus and Epimetheus**: Prometheus (whose name means "forethought") was punished by being chained to a rock in the Caucasus mountains. His brother Epimetheus ("afterthought") ignored warnings and accepted a "gift" from Zeus.


* 
**The Creation of Pandora**: Pandora was designed as a beautiful trap. Hephaestus shaped her like a goddess, the Charites (Graces) gave her beauty, and Athena taught her traditional skills.


* 
**The Pithos**: Pandora was given a jar (a *pithos* in Greek, not a box) containing all the world's ills and misfortunes. * **The Escape of Ills**: When Pandora opened the lid, all misfortunes escaped into the world.


* 
**Hope Remains**: Only hope (or anticipation) was left inside because she closed the lid before it could escape, which is why humanity cannot foresee the future but continues to hope for the best.



### The Ages of Man

* 
**Separate Tradition**: The myth of the races or ages of man is entirely independent of the Pandora story.


* 
**Fin de Siècle**: The myth expresses a *fin de siècle* atmosphere, a feeling of fatigue and a yearning for a magical, more peaceful past.


* 
**Moral Degeneration**: The gradual degradation of the human ages is primarily a moral degeneration, which subsequently causes physical hardships.


* 
**The Golden Age**: A paradisaical era without war, strife, or toil, where the earth abundantly provided food. This generation was created by the Titans, the older gods.


* 
**The Silver Age**: An inferior generation that sinned by refusing to sacrifice to the gods. Zeus destroyed them, and they became guardian spirits of the underworld.


* 
**The Bronze Age**: A violent age made of ash trees, dedicated to war and acts of violence. They had bronze houses and bronze weapons, ate no bread, and died nameless, going to the dank house of Hades.


* 
**The Age of Heroes (Digression)**: This fourth age breaks the pattern of metal degradation and was a superior, just race of demigods. This age explains the mythical ancestry of the Greeks and the heroes who fought at Thebes and Troy. Survivors were sent by Zeus to the Islands of the Blessed, beside the river Ocean, to live carefree lives where the earth bears fruit three times a year.


* 
**The Iron Age**: This represents Hesiod's contemporary generation, defined by constant toil, distress, and a mingling of good and evil.


* 
**The Grim Future**: Hesiod prophesies that the Iron Age will worsen until babies are born with gray hair. Family bonds and the rules of hospitality (Xenia) will completely break down.


* 
**Threpteria**: In the dark future, children will refuse to pay *threpteria*, which is the mandatory physical and financial reward owed to parents for rearing them.


* 
**Might Makes Right**: Justice will reside only in physical power, and people will honor evil, deceitful men who break their oaths.


* 
**The Departure of the Gods**: Envy (*Zelos*) will be ubiquitous, while Reverence (*Aidos*) and Indignation/Retribution (*Nemesis*) will wrap themselves in white mantles and abandon humanity for Mount Olympus.

## Part 2: Biblical Parallels and Ovid's Biography

### The Book of Daniel Parallel

* 
**King Nebuchadnezzar's Dream**: In the 6th century BC, King Nebuchadnezzar had a dream that only the prophet Daniel could interpret.


* 
**The Statue**: The king dreamt of an awesome statue with a head of fine gold, chest and arms of silver, belly and thighs of bronze, legs of iron, and feet of mixed iron and clay. * **Symbolism of Degeneration**: Much like Hesiod's myth, the descending value of the metals represents the moral and political degeneration of successive earthly kingdoms.


* 
**The Destruction**: The statue was ultimately smashed to pieces by a stone cut without hands.



### Introduction to Ovid

* 
**Early Life**: Ovid was born in Sulmo, Italy, in 43 BC, exactly a year after the assassination of Julius Caesar.


* 
**Career Path**: His father intended for him to become an orator, but Ovid was innately drawn to poetry, observing that everything he tried to say came out as verse.


* 
**Master of Elegy**: Ovid became a master of the love elegy during the Augustan age, writing works like the *Amores* (love poems) and the *Ars Amatoria* (The Art of Love, a mock-didactic poem about finding a spouse).


* 
**The Exile**: In 8 AD, Emperor Augustus exiled Ovid to Tomis, a desolate Greek colony on the Black Sea.


* 
**Carmen et Error**: Ovid claimed his exile was due to "carmen et error" (a poem and a mistake). The "carmen" is widely believed to be the *Ars Amatoria*, which clashed with Augustus's push for Roman austerity and chastity. The specific "error" remains unknown to history.



### Verify-Knowledge Questions: Part 2

1. How does Nebuchadnezzar's dream in the Book of Daniel mirror Hesiod's Ages of Man?
2. What was Ovid's original intended career path before he chose poetry?
3. What two reasons did Ovid give for his exile by Emperor Augustus?

## Part 3: Ovid’s *Metamorphoses* and the Creation

### Structure of the *Metamorphoses*

* 
**Scale and Scope**: The poem consists of 15 books of hexameter verse encompassing roughly 250 myths, all sharing the central theme of transformation (metamorphosis).


* 
**Not a Standard Epic**: Unlike the *Iliad* or *Odyssey*, the *Metamorphoses* lacks a single central character or unified plot.


* 
**Series of Epyllia**: The work is actually a massive collection of *epyllia* (the plural of *epyllion*, meaning a small-scale, short epic).


* 
**Ekphrasis**: Similar to these small epics, the poem utilizes *ekphrasis*, which is the literary description of a visual work of art (such as Homer's description of the shield of Achilles).


* 
**The Invocation**: Ovid opens the poem by invoking the gods, asking them to inspire his song that runs continuously from the origin of the world down to his own modern days.



### Ovid's Creation of the Universe

* 
**Primordial Chaos**: Ovid describes the beginning of the universe as a state of chaos where opposites (hot/cold, wet/dry, heavy/weightless) were inextricably intermingled and fighting.


* 
**Stoic Influence**: The strife of chaos was settled by "God or kindlier nature," reflecting the Stoic philosophical doctrine of a divine, rational Providence ordering the cosmos.


* 
**Separation by Weight**: The elements found their place based on weight. Fire (the weightless ether/stratosphere) took the highest place, followed by air, then earth, and finally water at the lowest point.


* 
**The Globe and Climate**: The creator molded the Earth into a globe and divided it into five distinct zones. These consist of the torrid (equatorial) zone, the two freezing poles, and the two temperate zones in between where humans can live. * **The Creation of Life**: After beasts, fish, and birds were assigned to their domains, Man was created last to be a sage and ruler.


* **Origins of Humanity**: Ovid offers a few possibilities for Man's creation. He suggests Man was created in God's image, formed from Earth that still retained a spark of celestial fire, or fashioned by Prometheus out of earth and water.


* 
**The Upright Posture**: While beasts look downward, humanity was given an upright posture. Heavily influenced by Stoicism, Ovid notes this was intentional so that humans could gaze at the heavens and stars rather than concerning themselves solely with earthly matters.



### Verify-Knowledge Questions: Part 3

1. What literary term describes the structure of Ovid's *Metamorphoses* as a collection of short epics?
2. What philosophical school heavily influenced Ovid's description of "God or kindlier nature" bringing order to chaos?
3. How does Ovid explain the physical separation of fire, air, earth, and water during creation?
4. According to Ovid, what is the philosophical purpose behind humanity's upright posture?

## Final Review: Mixed Questions

1. Compare and contrast how Hesiod and Ovid approach the concept of "origins" (Hesiod explaining the origin of human suffering via Pandora/Ages vs. Ovid explaining the physical origin of the universe).
2. What do the *fin de siècle* mood in Hesiod's Ages of Man and the descending metals in Nebuchadnezzar's dream have in common?
3. Name two instances where the text mentions the physical act of "looking" or "foresight" (Hint: Think about the name of the Titan who stole fire, and Ovid's reason for human posture).
4. Define the terms *epyllion*, *ekphrasis*, and *threpteria* based on the lecture material.
