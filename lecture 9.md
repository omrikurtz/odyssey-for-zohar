## Part 1: Administrative Details and Introduction to the Aeneid

This section covers the practical details for your final exam and introduces the historical and literary context of Virgil's epic.

### Course Administration & Final Exam Details

* The final exam is scheduled for January 10, following the end of the semester on January 9.


* The exam will consist of 25 questions distributed equally among three formats.


* Multiple-choice questions will be included.


* True/False questions will require you to evaluate a statement, sometimes requiring a written justification for your choice.


* Open-ended questions will require brief answers of only one to two short sentences, not essays.


* The exam duration is set for two hours.


* While greater weight will be given to Homer and Virgil, all discussed works (Herodotus, Hesiod, Ovid) will be represented.


* Listening to the recorded lectures is the recommended preparation method.



### Virgil and the Purpose of the Aeneid

* Virgil is widely considered the greatest of all Latin poets.


* The *Aeneid* connects the legendary Trojan founder of the Roman race, Aeneas, to the current ruler of the Roman Empire, Augustus.


* Augustus was the adopted son and great-nephew of Julius Caesar.


* Julius Caesar claimed descent from the goddess Venus, who was the divine mother of Aeneas.


* Aeneas's mortal father was Anchises.


* Aeneas's son, Iulus, is considered the source of the Julian clan to which Caesar and Augustus belonged.


* The primary purpose of the epic is to adore Augustus and his lineage indirectly by foreshadowing Rome's greatness through Aeneas.



### Structure and Opening of the Epic

* The *Aeneid* is an emulation of the Greek Homeric tradition.


* The first six books mirror the *Odyssey* (focusing on wanderings), while the remaining six books mirror the *Iliad* (focusing on war).


* The poem opens with the famous line, "I sing of arms and of the man".


* The narrative begins *in medias res* (into the midst of affairs), starting seven years after the destruction of Troy.


* Aeneas is introduced setting sail from Sicily toward Hesperia (also called Ausonia or Italy), the "land of the West".



### Juno's Wrath and the Storm

* The goddess Juno harbors a deep hatred for the Trojans for two reasons.


* First, the Trojan prince Paris spurned her beauty during the Judgment of Paris.


* Second, she favors the newly founded North African city of Carthage, ruled by Queen Dido, and wants to protect it from future Roman dominance.


* To impede Aeneas, Juno seeks the help of Aeolus, the King of the Winds, who keeps the tempestuous winds imprisoned in a vast cave in Aeolia.


* Juno promises Aeolus her most beautiful nymph, Deiopea, in permanent wedlock in exchange for his help.


* The Latin phrase for the 14 nymphs is "bis septem" (twice seven) because the word for fourteen does not fit the poem's hexameter meter.


* Aeolus unleashes a horrendous storm that scatters Aeneas's fleet and completely destroys one ship.


* The storm pushes the surviving Trojan ships to the shores of Carthage in Africa.

## Part 2: Carthage, Love, and the Fall of Troy

This section details Aeneas's time in Carthage, divine interventions, and his recounting of the tragic fall of his home city.

### Queen Dido and Divine Conspiracy

* Dido is the queen of Carthage and a Phoenician refugee from Sidon.


* She fled her homeland because her malevolent brother murdered her husband, Sychaeus, for his treasures.


* Carthage means "new city" in Phoenician, which is synonymous with "Punic" in Roman history.


* Upon meeting the stranded Trojans, Dido offers hospitality, stating her own past miseries taught her to help the unfortunate.


* Juno and Venus conspire to make Dido fall madly in love with Aeneas.


* Juno wants to trap Aeneas in Carthage to stop him from founding Rome, while Venus agrees in order to secure her son's immediate safety.


* Cupid (Eros) impersonates Aeneas's son Iulus (also known as Ascanius) and sits in Dido's lap during a banquet to shoot her with an arrow of passion.


* This scene is heavily inspired by Apollonius of Rhodes's *Argonautica*, where Hera and Athena make Medea fall in love with Jason.



### Aeneas Recounts the Fall of Troy

* At the banquet, Aeneas tells the story of Troy's destruction, paralleling Odysseus at the court of the Phaeacians.


* This narrative occupies Books 2 and 3 of the *Aeneid* and is the most elaborate ancient account of the fall of Troy.


* The Greeks leave a giant wooden horse on the shore and hide their fleet at the nearby island of Tenedos.


* The Trojan priest Laocoön warns his people, declaring, "I fear the Danaans even bearing gifts," and hurls a spear into the horse's belly.


* A Greek spy named Sinon tricks the Trojans with lies, claiming the horse is an offering to Minerva (Athena) and that bringing it inside will guarantee Trojan supremacy over Greece.


* As an omen, two massive sea serpents emerge from Tenedos and devour Laocoön and his two sons before hiding under Minerva's statue.


* The prophetess Cassandra foretells the disaster, but because she previously rejected the god Apollo, she is cursed to never be believed.


* The Trojans drag the horse into the city; at night, Sinon opens it, and the hidden Greeks emerge to lay waste to Troy.



### Katabasis: Journey to the Underworld

* Following the fall of Troy, Aeneas's father, Anchises, dies and is buried in Sicily, where Aeneas later holds funeral games in his honor.


* Upon reaching Cumae in Italy, Aeneas meets the Sibyl (prophetess of Apollo), who guides him into the Underworld, an epic tradition known as Katabasis.


* In the realm of Dis (Hades), Aeneas sees souls drinking from the river of forgetfulness for reincarnation, including future Roman heroes.


* He encounters Dido's spirit, who is reunited with Sychaeus and refuses to speak to him.


* Anchises's spirit prophesies Rome's destiny: while Greeks will excel in arts, astronomy, and oratory, the Roman art will be to impose civilization, spare the conquered, and fight down the proud.



### Verify Your Knowledge: Part 2

1. Who impersonates Ascanius to make Dido fall in love with Aeneas?
2. What phrase does Laocoön use to warn the Trojans about the wooden horse?
3. Why did no one believe Cassandra's warnings about the fall of Troy?
4. According to Anchises in the Underworld, what is the ultimate destiny and "art" of the Roman people?

## Part 3: War in Italy and the Tragedy of Dido

This section concludes the epic's narrative arcs, focusing on Aeneas's departure from Carthage and the bloody wars fought upon his arrival in Italy.

### Aeneas's Departure and Dido's Curse

* Dido had previously sworn a vow of chastity to the memory of her murdered husband, Sychaeus.


* Under Cupid's spell, she breaks this vow when she and Aeneas unite in a cave during a storm, which she perceives as a marriage.


* King Iarbas, a local African ruler whom Dido previously rejected, prays to Jupiter in anger over her union with Aeneas.


* Jupiter sends Mercury (Hermes) to remind Aeneas of his destiny to found a great nation.


* Aeneas unheroically attempts to leave Carthage in secret, but Dido discovers his plan and confronts him.


* As Aeneas sails away, an enraged Dido utters a terrifying curse that serves as an etiological myth for the Punic Wars.


* She commands future Carthaginians to hound Aeneas's descendants with hatred and prays for an "unknown Avenger" (a prophetic allusion to Hannibal) to arise from her bones.


* Unable to bear her shame and spurned love, Dido commits suicide by stabbing herself with Aeneas's sword atop a funeral pyre built of Trojan treasures.


* Aeneas looks back from the sea and sees the smoke billowing from Dido's pyre.



### The Iliadic Part: War in Italy

* The final six books of the *Aeneid* detail the wars in Italy, mirroring the *Iliad*.


* Aeneas lands at the mouth of the Tiber River near Laurentum, ruled by King Latinus.


* Recalling an ancient prophecy, King Latinus breaks his daughter Lavinia's engagement to the Rutulian leader Turnus and offers her to Aeneas.


* This broken engagement sparks a brutal war between the newly arrived Trojans and the local Italian tribes led by Turnus.


* Turnus serves as Aeneas's greatest mortal foe in Italy, creating a parallel to the rivalry between Hector and Achilles.


* The war is ultimately decided in a one-on-one duel between Aeneas and Turnus.


* Aeneas defeats Turnus and considers sparing his life.


* However, Aeneas sees Turnus wearing a belt taken as a spoil from Pallas, a young prince and friend of Aeneas.


* In a fit of implacable anger, Aeneas kills Turnus, and the epic ends abruptly with Turnus's soul fleeing into the Underworld.



### Verify Your Knowledge: Part 3

1. Why does Jupiter send Mercury to Aeneas in Carthage?
2. What historical conflict does Dido's dying curse provide a mythological origin for?
3. Who is Aeneas's main rival in Italy, and what sparks the war between them?
4. What specific item causes Aeneas to kill Turnus instead of showing mercy?
